![image_of_NYR_Shots](/rm_images/Rangers_Shot_Dashboard)

This repo was built to gather shot Data through the NHL.com API, and analyze the data using Python and Tableau.

In this repo I decided to gather all the "shots for" data for the New York Rangers for the 2020-21 season.

## Repo Contents
This repo contains:
- The functions I built to gather all the shot data from the NHL.com API

- A KMeans model used to segment the shot data
- A notebook with Hypothesis tests made on the shot data
- Basic visualizations made in Python
